## About Me

I am an SM student at MIT in the [Center of Computational Science and Engineering (CCSE)](https://cse.mit.edu/), advised by Dr. Kalyan Veeramachaneni, and a member of the [Data to AI Lab](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/) at LIDS. My research interest is in the field of Applied Machine Learning and Data Science. I work on applying deep learning to solve various challenges, particularly within the context of time series. I am also interested in building systems that democratize the usage of machine learning.

I spend my leisure time watching football _Â¡Hala Madrid!_. I enjoy running, climbing, traveling, and (most of all) consuming food.
